# What?

This is a docker container intended to run inside a kubernetes cluster to collect config maps with a specified label and store the included files in an local folder. It can also send an HTTP request to a specified URL after a configmap change. The main target is to be run as a sidecar container to supply an application with information from the cluster. The contained Python script is working from Kubernetes API 1.10.

# Why?

Currently (April 2018) there is no simple way to hand files in configmaps to a service and keep them updated during runtime.

# How?

Run the container created by this repo together with your application in an single pod with a shared volume. Specify which label should be monitored and where the files should be stored.
By adding additional env variables the container can send an HTTP request to specified URL.

# Where?

Images are available at:

- [docker.io/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar](https://hub.docker.com/r/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar)
- [quay.io/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar](https://quay.io/repository/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar)

Both are identical multi-arch images built for `amd64`, `arm64` and `arm/v7`

# Features

- Extract files from config maps
- Filter based on label
- Update/Delete on change of configmap
- Enforce unique filenames

# Usage 

Example for a simple deployment can be found in [`example.yaml`](./example.yaml). Depending on the cluster setup you have to grant yourself admin rights first: `kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole cluster-admin   --user $(gcloud config get-value account)`

One can override the default directory that files are copied into using a configmap annotation defined by the environment variable "FOLDER_ANNOTATION" (if not present it will default to "k8s-sidecar-target-directory"). The sidecar will attempt to create directories defined by configmaps if they are not present. Example configmap annotation:
  `k8s-sidecar-target-directory: "/path/to/target/directory"`

If the filename ends with `.url` suffix, the content will be processed as an URL the target file will be downloaded and used as the content file.
