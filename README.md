# What?

This is a docker container intended to run inside a kubernetes cluster to collect config maps with a specified label and store the included files in an local folder. It can also send an HTTP request to a specified URL after a configmap change. The main target is to be run as a sidecar container to supply an application with information from the cluster. The contained Python script is working from Kubernetes API 1.10.

# Why?

This is our simple way to provide files from configmaps or secrets to a service and keep them updated during runtime.

# How?

Run the container created by this repo together with your application in a single pod with a shared volume. Specify which label should be monitored and where the files should be stored.
By adding additional env variables the container can send an HTTP request to specified URL.

# Where?

Images are available at:

- [docker.io/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar](https://hub.docker.com/r/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar)
- [quay.io/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar](https://quay.io/repository/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar)

Both are identical multi-arch images built for `amd64`, `arm64`, `arm/v7`, `ppc64le` and `s390x`

# Features

- Extract files from config maps and secrets
- Filter based on label
- Update/Delete on change of configmap or secret
- Enforce unique filenames

# Usage 

Example for a simple deployment can be found in [`example.yaml`](./example.yaml). Depending on the cluster setup you have to grant yourself admin rights first:
```shell
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole cluster-admin   --user $(gcloud config get-value account)
```

One can override the default directory that files are copied into using a configmap annotation defined by the environment variable `FOLDER_ANNOTATION` (if not present it will default to `k8s-sidecar-target-directory`). The sidecar will attempt to create directories defined by configmaps if they are not present. Example configmap annotation:
```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s-sidecar-target-directory: "/path/to/target/directory"
```

If the filename ends with `.url` suffix, the content will be processed as a URL which the target file contents will be downloaded from. If the source requires authentication, currently http basic-auth and token based authentication via query param are supported. Please see the variables below for details.
