# Contributions welcome!

We love contributions of any form and there's almost nothing special to take care of. Just fork, work on it, create a PR which is labelled with any of `enhancement`, `bug`, `test`, `dependencies` or `other`. Commit messages should refer to any affected tickets  and we do [auto-versioning using commit messages](https://github.com/anothrNick/github-tag-action). So - if any commit of you is worth a release - please add either `#patch`, `#minor` or `#major` into the message to trigger appropriate version bump, tagging and release.
